    <h1><b><u>Compatibility</u></b></h1>
    <p>To check if your CPU is compatible, you need to check your motherboard or GPU. Your motherboard should have the correct socket (AMD and Intel have separate sockets), and that it has the proper chipset. You can check your motherboard by making sure that the motherboard has the same socket and chipset that your CPU requires, that the ram will operate, that the GPU will not be bottlenecked, and that your storage will work as intended. Check your ram by making sure that both the CPU and motherboard support the speed and generation. Check your storage compatibility by making sure that your motherboard supports that type of storage. Check your GPU by making sure that your motherboard and CPU do not bottleneck. Check your PSU by making sure that the amount of power that the system requires does not exceed the amount of power that the power supply can produce.</p>
