    <h2> Why You Should Build A PC</h2>	
    <p> Building a PC is something everyone should know how to do. This is something that teaches you the basics of pc hardware. Building a PC is something that you can do right after learning what is, and it also saves MONEY. 
      When you want to look for a desktop for yourself to buy, you want to save as much money as you can because you don’t want to pay for additional charges that manufacturers generally include in pre-built pc’s and then there 
      is always manufacturing and building costs. These can be eradicated by building a pc. You also get the benefit of knowing what your hardware is and how it should function because you should research it prior to building it. Building a 
      PC also increases experience with computer hardware so that the next time you build some kind of computer hardware, not necessarily having to be a pc, you can be an expert of the task. Building a PC will also teach you on why you should 
      build one and once you build one you will never go back to buying a prebuilt PC or laptops. The most important thing about PC building though is the flexibility, beacause you don't have to be an PC expert or someone who has a great knowledge of PCs. 
      PC building is for everyone. It can be for people who have 
      never done it before, people who want to switch to PC from console for gaming, people who want a powerful machine and end up getting a laptop, and many more types of people. PC building is for everyone so don't be scared.</p>
