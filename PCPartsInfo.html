    <h1><b><u>INDIVIDUAL PARTS</u></b></h1>
    <h2>CPU</h2>
    <p>CPU’s - The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the most important part of your system. The CPU indirectly decides your Graphics Card, your motherboard type, and the type of Ram(Random Access Memory) you require. This is why a lot of thought should be put in for your CPU. The CPU should be one of the main highlights of your system.</p>

    <h2>Motherboard</h2>
    <p>Motherboard - The Motherboard entirely depends on your CPU. Your CPU will decide which platform your motherboard will be either Z390(Intel) or AM4 X570(AMD). Motherboards are the platform where all the parts connect so it is very important you look at the specification of the motherboard to make sure everything is compatible. The motherboard has the CPU socket, where the CPU lies, the RAM slots, the PCI-e slots (where the GPU goes), and onboard headers for things like USB, RGB, and fans.</p>

    <h2>RAM</h2>
    <p> Also known as Random-Access-Memory, is a form of computer memory that can be read and changed in any order. This is typically used to store working data and machine code. A random-access memory device allows data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory. This is where short term computer files are stored.</p>

    <h2>Storage</h2>
    <p>Storage is where computer files are stored in the long term. Things like photos are stored here. SSDs and NVME SSDs are faster types of storage. Fast storage is important because things like windows can load in seconds compared to hard drives which take minutes to load. They also write files much faster so large files will be uploaded in seconds.</p>

    <h2>GPU</h2>
    <p>the GPU is the part that controls video output. The more powerful this is, the more FPS or frames per second you will get. You want a powerful GPU for video games because you want to maximize FPS. The GPU controls the video output which means it controls what gets displayed on the display. You really want to prioritize your budget for a GPU.</p>

    <h2>PSU</h2>
    <p>also know as the power supply is what provides electrical power to your system. When choosing this part, you want to aim for something gold-rated or platinum rated. You also don’t want your system power demand to exceed your power supply ratings.</p>

    <h2>Case</h2>
    <p>Case - The case is where you put all of your parts. Without the case, your parts would be unorganized and would probably short circuit. A case serves as a protective housing area for all of the parts in your system. The case also includes some I/O like usb ports, mic and audio jacks, and the power and reset switches.</p>
