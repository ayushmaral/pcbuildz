      Congrats! You have reached the end of this guide, which hopefully has not only persuaded you to not only purchase a PC, but feel confident and driven to build your own PCs. Although you may have viewed PC building as complicated in the past, it is important for you to know that it is much more intuitive than it sounds. There are 7 main parts that are needed in any PC build: the CPU, motherboard, RAM, storage, GPU, PSU, and the case. When picking these parts, it is important to pay attention to compatibility, so that each part can work with the others. PCPartPicker is an amazing service that can make the job easier for you. Lastly, it is important to also consider your possible budget, so you can maximize your PCs parts and therefore, its performance for your PC while still staying under the budget. Now, you have the necessary knowledge required to build your own PC. Good Luck!
